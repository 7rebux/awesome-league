When describing the thing that you're adding, please try describing it objectively, i.e. don't describe like "the best lcu library" etc.
Please also make sure that your descriptions are gramatically correct and end with a period sign. 
If a linter reports failure in your pull request, try fixing it yourself first. (look at the error description)
